# Title Companion Guide for Regex

This companion guide was carefully researched and prepared for you to help ease frustration along your coding journey that you might experience while working with Regular Expressions, otherwise known as Regex in Javascript. Although "regular" is literally in the name, they might not seem so at first, but when properly understood and used correctly, you will use them often, and make cleaner code as a result. That is where we come in and this guide will help you to find your way out of those low valleys and propel you right back on track to reach your peak coding potential.

## Summary

## Author

With over 13 years of professional experience in business intel and reporting analytics while working in the telecommunications and technology industries, Brian King has taken a pause in his career to pursue a new career in web development, and is currently living the "coding-life," as he regularly quips to friends and family. Eat, sleep, and dream about code -- rinse and repeat! During the crucible of learning to code while enrolled in an intensive boot camp curriculum, Brian learned firsthand the value of great online resources, clean code, and the rather surprising willingness of the developer community to share and give back to the profession that they love. Struck by this refreshing community, this guide is his small contribution to that community that has shared so much with him, and is hopefully the first of many more to come in the future.  Enjoy and happy coding!
